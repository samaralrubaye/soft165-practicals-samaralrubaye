# SOFT165_EX1
Exercise 01 for SOFT165 module

This project repository is for SOFT165 students to practice interacting with a Git repository.

## Activities
During the course of the next 6 weeks you will carry out web development activities, practicing and then demonstrating your skills.

The first exercise is for you to clone the repository, create a branch with your own name, then push the code back onto the repo.  

You are then expected to work on your own branch.
