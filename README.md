# SOFT165_EX1
Exercise 01 for SOFT165 module

This project repository is for SOFT165 students to practice interacting with a Git repository.

## Activities
During the course of the next 6 weeks you will carry out web development activities, practicing and then demonstrating your skills.

The first exercise is for you to clone the repository, create a branch with your own name, then push the code back onto the repo.  
You are then expected to work on your own branch.

## Create a pull request to contribute your changes back into master
Pull requests are the way to move changes from a topic branch back into the master branch.  We will do this at the end of the exercises.

Click on the **Pull Requests** page in the **CODE** hub, then click "New Pull Request" to create a new pull request from your topic branch to the master branch.

When you are done adding details, click "Create Pull request". Once a pull request is sent, reviewers can see your changes, recommend modifications, or even push follow-up commits.
